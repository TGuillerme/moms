\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Multidimensional analysis of traits are now a common toolkit in
  ecology and evolution and are based on trait spaces in which each
  dimension summarise the observed trait combination (a morphospace or
  an ecospace). Observations of interest will typically occupy a
  subspace of this space, and researchers will apply one or more
  measures to quantify the way in which organisms ``inhabit'' that trait
  space. In macroevolution and ecology these measures are referred to as
  disparity or dissimilarity metrics and can be generalised as space
  occupancy measures. Researchers use these measures to investigate how
  space occupancy changes through time, in relation to other groups of
  organisms, and in response to global environmental changes, such as
  global warming events or mass extinctions. However, the mathematical
  and biological meaning of most space occupancy measures is vague with
  the majority of widely-used measures lacking formal description.
\item
  Here we propose a broad classification of space occupancy measures
  into three categories that capture changes in size, density, or
  position. We analyse the behaviour of 25 measures to study changes in
  trait space size, density and position on a series of simulated and
  empirical datasets.
\item
  We find no one measure describes all of trait space but that some
  measures are better at capturing certain aspects compared to other
  approaches and that their performance depends on both the trait space
  and the hypothesis analysed. However, our results confirm the three
  broad categories (size, density and position) and allow to relate
  changes in any of these categories to biological phenomena.
\item
  Since the choice of space occupancy measures should be specific to the
  data and question at had, we introduced
  \href{https://tguillerme.shinyapps.io/moms/}{\texttt{moms}}, a
  user-friendly tool based on a graphical interface that allows users to
  both visualise and measure changes space occupancy for any metrics in
  simulated or imported trait spaces. Users are also provided with tools
  to transform their data in space (e.g.~contraction, displacement,
  etc.). This tool is designed to help researchers choose the right
  space occupancy measures, given the properties of their trait space
  and their biological question.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Groups of species and environments share specific, easily recognisable,
correlated characteristics of many kinds: guilds or biomes with shared
phenotypic, physiological, phylogenetic or behavioural traits. Organisms
or environments should therefore be studied as a set of traits rather
than some specific traits in isolation (Donohue et al. 2013; Hopkins and
Gerber 2017). Biologists have increasingly been using ordination
techniques (see Legendre and Legendre 2012 for a summary) to create
multidimensional trait spaces to either explore properties of the data
or test hypotheses (Oksanen et al. 2007; Adams and Otárola-Castillo
2013; Bonhomme et al. 2014; Blonder 2018; Guillerme 2018). For example,
in palaeobiology, Wright (2017) used trait spaces to study how groups of
species' characteristics change through time; in ecology, Jones et al.
(2015) study evidence of competition by looking at trait overlap between
two populations. However, different fields use a different set of terms
for such approaches (Table 1). Nonetheless, they are the same
mathematical objects: matrices with columns representing an original or
transformed trait value and rows representing observations, such as
taxon, field site, etc. (Guillerme 2018).

Table 1: terms and equivalence between mathematics, ecology and
macroevolution.

Ecologists and evolutionary biologists also often use trait spaces with
respect to the same fundamental questions: are groups occupying the same
amount of trait space? Do some groups have contain more species than
others in the same amount of trait space? Are some specific factors
correlated to different patterns of occupancy of the trait space
(e.g.~are some factors correlated with more occupancy)?? Because of the
multidimensional nature of these trait spaces, it is often not possible
to study them use bi- or tri-variate techniques. Studying the occupancy
of trait spaces can be achieved using disparity metrics in
macroevolution (Wills 2001; Hopkins and Gerber 2017; Guillerme 2018) or
comparing hypervolumes in ecology (Donohue et al. 2013; Díaz et al.
2016; Blonder 2018; Mammola 2019). However, although these space
occupancy measures are common in ecology and evolution, surprisingly
little work has been published on their behaviour (but see Ciampaglio et
al. 2001; Villéger et al. 2008; Mammola 2019).

Different space occupancy measures capture different aspects of the
trait space (ciampaglio2001; Villéger et al. 2008; Mammola 2019). It may
be widely-known by many in the field, but to our knowledge this is
infrequently mentioned in peer-reviewed papers. First, space occupancy
measures are often named as the biological aspect they are describing
(e.g. ``disparity'' or ``functional diversity'') rather than what they
are measuring (e.g.~the average pairwise distances) which obscures the
differences or similarities between studies. Second, in many studies in
ecology and evolution, authors have focused on measuring the size of the
trait space with different measures (e.g.~ellipsoid volume Donohue et
al. 2013; hypervolume Díaz et al. 2016; Procrustes variance Marcy et al.
2016; product of variance Wright 2017). However, the size of the trait
space only represents a single aspects of occupancy, disregarding others
such as the density (Harmon et al. 2008) or position (Wills 2001;
Ciampaglio et al. 2001). For example, if two groups have the same trait
space size, this will lead to supporting certain biological conclusions.
Yet, an alternative aspect of space occupancy may indicate that the
groups' position are different; this would likely lead to a different
biological conclusion (e.g.~the groups are equally diverse but occupy
different niches). Using metrics that only measure one aspect of the
multidimensional trait space may restrain the potential of
multidimensional analysis (Villéger et al. 2008).

Here we propose a broad classification of space occupancy measures as
used across ecology and evolution and analyse their power to detect
changes in trait space occupancy in simulated and empirical data. Note
that we refer to occupancy here as the general term for where
observations are in a trait space. This definition excludes whether
spaces are are truly ``occupiable'' (e.g.~are there limits to the space,
are some regions of the space inapplicable, etc.) which might be of
importance in particulare spaces (e.g.~in tree spaces; Hillis et al.
(2005)). We provide an assessment of each broad type of space occupancy
measures along with a unified terminology to foster communication
between ecology and evolution. Unsurprisingly, we found no one measure
describes all changes through a trait space and the results from each
measurement are dependent on the characteristics of the space and the
hypotheses. Furthermore, because there can potentially be an infinite
number of measures, it would be impossible to propose clear generalities
to space occupancy measures behavior. Therefore, we propose
\href{https://tguillerme.shinyapps.io/moms/}{\texttt{moms}}, a
user-friendly tool allowing researchers to design, experiment and
visualise their own space occupancy measure tailored for their specific
project and helping them understanding the ``null'' behavior of their
measures of interest.

\subsection{Space occupancy measures}\label{space-occupancy-measures}

In this paper, we define trait spaces as any matrix where rows are
observations and columns are traits, where both observations and traits
are structurally related (e.g.~there is a phylogenetic relation between
observations - and traits, etc.). These traits can widely vary in number
and types: they could be coded as discrete (e.g.~presence or absence of
a bone; Beck and Lee 2014; Wright 2017), continuous measurements
(e.g.~leaf area; Díaz et al. 2016) or more sophisticated measures
(Fourier ellipses; Bonhomme et al. 2014; e.g.~landmark position; Marcy
et al. 2016). Traits can also be measured by using relative observations
(e.g.~community compositions; Jones et al. 2015) or distance between
observations (e.g. Close et al. 2015). However, regardless of the
methodology used to build a trait space, three broad occupancy metrics
can be measured: the size which will approximate the amount of space
occupied, the density which will approximate the distribution in space
and the position which will approximate the location in space (Fig. 1;
Villéger et al. 2008). Of course any combination of these three aspects
is always possible.

\end{figure}
Figure 1: different type of information captured by space
occupancy measures. A - Size (e.g.~sum of ranges); B - Density
(e.g.~pairwise distances); C - Position (e.g.~distances from centre).

\paragraph{1. Size}\label{size}

Size measures the spread of a group in the trait space. They can be
interpreted as the amount of the trait space that is occupied by
observations. Typically, larger values for such measures indicate the
presence of more extreme trait combinations. For example, if group A has
is bigger than group B, the observations in A achieve more extreme trait
combinations than in B. This type of measure is widely used in both
ecology (e.g.~the hypervolume; Blonder 2018) and in evolution (e.g.~the
sum or product of ranges or variances; Wills 2001).

Although size measures are a suitable indicator for comparing a group's
trait space occupancy, it is limited to comparing the range of
trait-combinations between groups. Size measures do not take into
account the distribution of the observations within a group and can be
sensible to innocupied ``holes'' in it (Blonder 2018). In other words,
they can make it difficult to determine whether all the observations are
on the edge of the volume or whether the size is simply driven by small
number of extreme observations.

\paragraph{2. Density}\label{density}

Density measures an indication of the quantity of observations in the
trait space. They can be interpreted as the distribution of the
observations \emph{within} a group in the trait space. Groups with
higher density have more observations within it (i.e.~more observations
per approximation of size) that will tend to be more similar to each
other. For example, if group A is greater than group B and both have the
same density (observations are equally distant within each group),
similar mechanisms could be driving both groups' trait space occupancy.
However, this might suggest that A is older and had more time to achieve
more extreme trait combinations under essentially the same process
(Endler et al. 2005). Note that density based measures can be sensitive
to sampling. Density is less commonly measured compared to size, but it
is still used in both ecology (e.g.~the minimum spanning tree length;
Oksanen et al. 2007) and evolution (e.g.~the average pairwise distance;
Harmon et al. 2008).

\paragraph{3. Position}\label{position}

Position measures where a group lies in trait space. They can be
interpreted as where a group lies in the trait space either relative to
the space itself or relative to another group. For example, if group A
has a different position than group B, observations in A will have a
different trait-combination than B.

Position measurements may be harder to interpret in multidimensional
spaces. For example in a 2D space, two groups can be equally distant
from a fixed point but in different parts of the space left, right up or
down (with the position possibilities increasing with the number of
dimensions). However, when thinking about unidimensional data (one
trait), this measure is obvious: two groups A or B could have the same
variance (i.e. ``size'' or spread) with the same number of observations
(i.e.~density) but could have a different mean and thus be in different
positions. These measures have been used in ecology to compare the
position of two groups relatively to each other (Mammola 2019).

\subsection{No measure to rule them all: benefits of considering
multiple
measures}\label{no-measure-to-rule-them-all-benefits-of-considering-multiple-measures}

The use of multiple measurements to assess trait space occupancy has the
benefit of providing a more detailed characterisation of occupancy
changes. If the question of interest is, say, to look at how space
occupancy changes in response to mass extinction, using a single space
occupancy measure can miss part of the picture: a change in size could
be decoupled from a change in position or density in trait space. For
example, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (66 million years ago -
Mya) has been linked to an increase in size of the mammalian trait space
(adaptive radiation; Halliday and Goswami 2016) but more specific
questions can be answered by looking at other aspects of trait space
occupancy: does the radiation expand on previously existing morphologies
(elaboration, increase in density; Endler et al. 2005) or does it
explore new regions of the trait space (innovation, change in position;
Endler et al. 2005)? Similarly, in ecology, if two groups have the same
trait space size, it can be interesting to look at differences in
density within these two groups: different selection pressure can lead
to different density within equal sized groups.

Here, we provide the first interdisciplinary review of 25 space
occupancy measures that uses the broad classification of measures into
size, density and position to capture pattern changes in trait space. We
assess the behaviour of measures using simulations and six
interdisciplinary empirical datasets covering a wide range of potential
data types and biological questions. We also introduce a tool for
measuring occupancy in multidimensional space
(\href{https://tguillerme.shinyapps.io/moms/}{\texttt{moms}}), which is
a user-friendly, open-source, graphical interface to allow the tailored
testing of measurement behaviour for any use case.
\href{https://tguillerme.shinyapps.io/moms/}{\texttt{moms}} will allow
workers to comprehensively assess the properties of their trait space
and the measures associated with their specific biological question.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

We tested how 25 different space occupancy measures relate to each
other, are affected by modifications of traits space and affect group
comparisons in empirical data. To do so, we performed the following
steps (explained in more detail below):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We simulated 13 different spaces with different sets of parameters;
\item
  We transformed these spaces by removing 50\% of the observations
  following four different scenarios corresponding to different
  empirical scenarios: randomly, by limit (e.g.~expansion or reduction
  of niches), by density (e.g.~different degrees of competition within a
  guild) and by position (e.g.~ecological niche shift).
\item
  We measured occupancy on the resulting transformed spaces using eight
  different space occupancy measures;
\item
  We applied the same space occupancy measures to six empirical datasets
  (covering a range of disciplines and a range of dataset properties).
\end{enumerate}

Note that the paper contains the results for only eight measures which
were selected as representative of common metrics covering the size,
density and position trait space aspects. However, the results for the
additional 17 measures is available in the supplementary material 4.

\subsection{Generating spaces}\label{generating-spaces}

We generated trait spaces using the following combinations of size,
distributions, variance and correlation:

\end{longtable}

Table 2: different simulated space distribution. \emph{Name} of the
simulated space in this paper; \emph{dimensions} of the matrix
(row*columns); \emph{distribution(s)} of the data on each dimensions
(for the `Random' space, each dimension is randomly chosen to be Normal,
Uniform or Lognormal); \emph{dimension variance}: distribution of the
variance between dimensions (when equal, the dimensions have the same
variance, otherwise, the variance per dimensions is decreasing either
lognormally (multiplicative) or normally (additive); \emph{correlation}
between dimensions.

The differences in trait space sizes (200 \(\times\) 3, 200 \(\times\)
15, 200 \(\times\) 50 or 200 \(\times\) 150) reflects the range of
dimensions in literature: ``low-dimension'' spaces (\(<15\)) are common
in ecology (Mammola 2019) whereas high dimension spaces (\(>100\)) are
common in macroevolution (Hopkins and Gerber 2017). We used a range of
distributions (uniform, normal or a random combination of uniform,
normal and lognormal) to test the effect of observation distributions on
the measurements. We used different levels of variance for each
dimensions in the spaces by making the variance on each dimension either
equal (\(\sigma_{D1} \simeq \sigma_{D2} \simeq \sigma_{Di}\)) or
decreasing (\(\sigma_{D1} < \sigma_{D2} < \sigma_{Di}\)) with the
decreasing factor being either multiplicative (using the cumulative
product of the inverse of the number of dimensions: \(\prod_i^d(1/d)\))
or additive (\(\sum_i^d(1/d)\)). Both multiplicative and cumulative
reductions of variance are used to illustrate the properties of
ordinations where the variance decreases per dimensions (and in a normal
way in Multidimensional Scaling - MDS, PCO or PCoA; e.g. Close et al.
2015; in a lognormal way in principal components analysis - PCA; e.g.
Marcy et al. 2016; Wright 2017; Healy et al. 2019). Finally, we added a
correlation parameter to take into account the potential correlation
between different traits to illustrate the effect of co-linearity
between traits (especially in non-ordinated trait spaces). We repeated
the simulation of each trait space 20 times (resulting in 260 trait
spaces).

\subsection{Spatial occupancy
measures}\label{spatial-occupancy-measures}

We then measured eight different metrics on the resulting transformed
spaces, including a new measure we produced, the average displacement,
which we expect to be influenced by changes in trait space position.

observations, \emph{d} the total number of dimensions, \emph{k} any

\(\sigma^{2}\) their variance. \(\Gamma\) is the Gamma distribution and
\(\lambda_{i}\) the eigenvalue of each dimension and \({q}_{i}\) and
\(p_{i}\) are any pairs of coordinates.

We selected these eight space occupancy measures to illustrate how they
capture different aspects of space occupancy (but note that this is not
an expression of our preference). The supplementary material 4 contains
the same analysis as described below, performed on a total of 25
measures. Note that these measures are specific to trait spaces that are
Euclidean (distances in the space reflect true distances between points)
and isotropic (it is as easy to traverse the space in any direction).
Furthermore, \href{https://tguillerme.shinyapps.io/moms/}{\texttt{moms}}
allows exploring the effect of many more measures as well as the
customisation of measures by combining them or using user-designed
functions.

\subsection{Measure comparisons}\label{measure-comparisons}

We compared the space occupancy measures correlations across all
simulations between each pair of measures to assess their captured
signal (Villéger et al. 2008; Laliberté and Legendre 2010). We used the
measures on the full 13 trait spaces described above. We then scaled the
results and measured the pairwise Pearson correlation to test whether
measures were capturing a similar signal (high positive correlation), a
different signal (correlation close to 0) or an opposite signal (high
negative correlations) using the \texttt{psych} package (Revelle 2018).

\subsection{Changing space}\label{changing-spaces}

To assess how the measures responded to changes within trait spaces, we
removed 50\% of observations each time using the following algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Randomly:} by randomly removing 50\% of observations (Fig.
  2-A). This reflects a ``null'' biological model of changes in trait
  space: the case when observations are removed regardless of their
  intrinsic characteristics. For example, if diversity is reduced by
  50\% but the trait space size remains the same, there is a decoupling
  between diversity and space occupancy (Ruta et al. 2013). Our selected
  measures are expected to not be affected by this change.
\item
  \textbf{Limit:} by removing all observations with a distance from the
  centre of the trait space lower or greater than a radius \(\rho\)
  (where \(\rho\) is chosen such that 50\% observations are selected)
  generating two limit removals: \emph{maximum} and \emph{minimum}
  (respectively in orange and blue; Fig. 2-B). This can reflect a strict
  selection model where observations with trait values below or above a
  threshold are removed leading to an expansion or a contraction of the
  trait space. Size measures are expected to be most affected by this
  change.
\item
  \textbf{Density:} by removing any pairs of point with a distance \(D\)
  from each other where (where \(D\) is chosen such that 50\%
  observations are selected) generating two density removals:
  \emph{high} and \emph{low} (respectively in orange and blue; Fig.
  2-C). This can reflect changes within groups in the trait space due to
  ecological factors (e.g.~competition can generate niche repulsion -
  lower density; Grant and Grant 2006). Density measures are expected to
  be most affected by this change.
\item
  \textbf{Position:} by removing points similarly as for \textbf{Limit}
  but using the distance from the furthest point from the centre
  generating two position removals: \emph{positive} and \emph{negative}
  (respectively in orange and blue; Fig. 2-D). This can reflect global
  changes in trait space due, for example, to an entire group remaining
  diverse but occupying a different niche. Position measures are
  expected to be most affected by this change.
\end{itemize}

The algorithm to select \(\rho\) or \(D\) is described in greater detail
in in the Supplementary material 1.

Figure 2: different type of space reduction. Each panel
displays two groups of 50\% of the data points each. Each group (orange
and blue) are generated using the following algorithm: A - randomly; B -
by limit (maximum and minimum limit); C - by density (high and low); and
D - by position (positive and negative). Panel E et F represents two
typical display of the reduction results displayed in Table 5: the dots
represent the median space occupancy values across all simulations for
each scenario of trait space change (Table 2), the solid and dashed line
respectively the 50\% and 95\% confidence intervals. Results in grey are
the random 50\% reduction (panel A). Results in blue and orange
represent the opposite scenarios from panels B, C, and D. The displayed
value is the amount of overlap (Bhattacharrya Coefficient) between the
blue or orange distributions and the grey one. Panel E and F shows
respectively the ``ideal'' and ``worst'' results for any type of
measures, where the space occupancy measurement respectively manages or
fails to captures a specific type of reduction (i.e.~size, position or
density; Table 5).


To assess the effect of space reduction, distribution and dimensionality
on the measure, we scaled the measure to be relative to the non-reduced
space for each dimension distribution or number of dimensions. We
subtracted the observed occupancy with no space reduction to all the
occupancy measures of the reduced spaces and then divided it by the
resulting maximum observed occupancy. Since the occupancy measures are
dependent on their trait space, we scaled and centred them between -1
and 1 to make them comparable. A value of 0 indicating no effect of the
space reduction and \(>0\) and \(<0\) respectively indicating an
increase or decrease in the occupancy measure value. We then measured
the amount of overlap between the non-random removals (limit, density
and position) and the random removals using the Bhattacharrya
Coefficient (amount of overlap between two distributions; Bhattacharyya
1943).

\subsubsection{Measuring the effect of space and dimensionality on
shifting
spaces}\label{measuring-the-effect-of-space-and-dimensionality-on-shifting-spaces}

Distribution differences and the number of dimensions can have an effect
on the measure results. For example, in a normally distributed space, an
increase in density can often lead to a decrease in size. This is not
necessarily true in log-normal spaces or in uniform spaces for certain
measures. Furthermore, high dimensional spaces (\textgreater{}10) are
subject to the ``curse of multidimensionality'' (Bellman 1957): data
becomes sparser with increasing number of dimensions. This can have two
main unforeseen mathematical consequence: 1) the probability of overlap
between two groups decreases as a product of the number of dimensions;
and 2) the amount of samples needed to ``fill'' the spaces increases
exponentially
\href{https://observablehq.com/@tophtucker/theres-plenty-of-room-in-the-corners}{see
this interactive illustration by Toph Tucker}. Furthermore computational
time can be increased exponentially rather than linearly with the number
of dimensions. Therefore, the ``curse'' can make the interpretation of
high dimensional data counter-intuitive. For example if a group expands
in multiple dimensions (i.e.~increase in size), the actual hypervolume
(\(\prod_{i}^{d} range_{Di}\)) can decrease (Fig. 3 and Tables 6, 7).

We measured the effect of space distribution and dimensionality using an
ANOVA (\(occupancy \sim distribution\) and
\(occupancy \sim dimensions\)) by using all spaces with 50 dimensions
and the uniform and normal spaces with equal variance and no correlation
with 3, 15, 50, 100 and 150 dimensions (Table 2) for testing
respectively the effect of distribution and dimensions. The results of
the ANOVAs (\emph{p}-values) are reported in Table 5 (see supplementary
material 3 for the full ANOVA result tables).

\subsection{Empirical examples}\label{empirical-examples}

We analysed the effect of the different space occupancy measures on six
different empirical studies covering a broad range of fields that employ
trait space analyses (palaeobiology, macroevolution, evo-devo, ecology,
etc.). For each of these studies we generated trait spaces from the data
published with the papers. We divided each trait spaces into two
biologically-relevant groups and tested whether the measures
differentiated the groups in different ways. Both the grouping and the
questions were based on a simplified version of the topics of these
papers (with no intention to re-analyse the data but to be
representative of the diversity of questions in ecology and evolution).
The procedures to generate the data and the groups varies from one study
to the other but is detailed and fully reproducible in the supplementary
materials 2.

Table 4: details of the six empirical trait spaces.

For each empirical trait space we bootstrapped each group 500 times
(Guillerme 2018) and applied the eight space occupancy measure to each
pairs of groups. We then compared the means of each groups using the
Bhattacharrya Coefficient (Bhattacharyya 1943).

All the measures were either positively correlated (Pearson correlation
of 0.99 for the average Euclidean distance from centroid and sum of
variance or 0.97 for the average nearest neighbour distance and minimum
spanning tree average length; Fig. 3) or somewhat correlated (ranging
from 0.66 for the sum of variances and the ellipsoid volume to -0.09
between the average displacement and the average Euclidean distance from
centroid; Fig. 3). All measures but the ellipsoid volume were normally
(or nearly normally) distributed (Fig. 3). More comparisons between

Table 5: Results of the effect of space reduction, space dimension
distributions and dimensions number of the different space occupancy
measures. See Fig. 2 for interpretation of the figures distributions and
values. F-values for distribution effect and dimensions effect
represents respectively the effect of the ANOVAs space occupancy
\textasciitilde{} distributions and space occupancy \textasciitilde{}
dimension represent the ratio of sum squared difference within and
between groups (the higher, the more the factor has an effect on the
measure) and associated \emph{p}-values (0 `***' 0.001 `**' 0.01 `*'
0.05 `.' 0.1 '' 1). This figure illustrates how different measures can
be influenced by different aspects of changes in the trait space. For
example, the Average Euclidean distance from centroid (row 1) captures
mainly changes in size (column 1), but also captures changes in density
(column 2) but does not capture changes in position (column 3).

As expected, some different measures capture different aspects of space
occupancy. However, it can be hard to predict the behaviour of each
measure when 50\% of the observations are removed. We observe a clear
decrease in median metric in less than a third of the space reductions
(10/36).

In terms of change in size, only the average Euclidean distance from
centroid and the sum of variances seem to capture a clear change in both
directions. However, the increase in size does not correspond to an
\emph{actual} increase in volume in the trait space (i.e.~the volume
from the blue observations in Fig. 2-B is equivalent to the one in Fig.
2-A). In terms of change in density, only the minimum spanning tree
average distance and the average nearest neighbour distance seem to
capture a clear change in both directions. In terms of change in
position, only the average displacement metric seems to capture a clear
change in direction (albeit not in both directions). This is not
surprising, since the notion of positions becomes more and more complex
to appreciate as dimensionality increases (i.e.~beyond left/right,
up/down and front/back).

Table 6: Comparisons of pairs of groups in different empirical trait
spaces. NAs are used for cases where space occupancy could not be
measured due to the curse of multidimensionality. The displayed values
are the amount of overlap between both groups (Bhattacharrya
Coefficient). The orange and blue boxplots represent the trait space
occupancy for the following groups from left to right: crown \emph{vs.}
stem mammals; crinoids before \emph{vs.} after the end-Ordovician
extinction; \emph{Megascapheus} \emph{vs.} \emph{Thomomys}; adults
\emph{vs.} juveniles trilobites; aspens \emph{vs.} grasslands
communities; ecthotherms \emph{vs.} endotherms.

Similarly as for the simulated results, the empirical ones indicate that
there can be no perfect one-size-fit all measurement. For all eight
measures (except the ellipsoid volume) we see either one group or the
other having a bigger mean than the other and no consistent case where a
group has a bigger mean than the other for all the measures. For
example, in the Beck and Lee (2014)'s dataset, there is a clear
difference in size using the average Euclidean distance from centroid or
the sum of variances (overlaps of respectively 0.175 and 0.159) but no
overlap when measuring the size using the sum of ranges (0.966).
However, for the Hopkins and Pearson (2016)'s dataset, this pattern is
reversed (no clear differences for the average Euclidean distance from
centroid or the sum of variances - 0.701 and 0.865 respectively) but a
clear difference for the sum of ranges (0). Furthermore, for each
dataset, the absolute differences between each groups is not consistent
depending on the measures. For example, in Hopkins and Pearson (2016)'s
dataset, the orange group's mean is clearly higher than the blue one
when measuring the sum of ranges (0) and the inverse is true when
measuring the average displacement (0).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Here we tested 25 measures of trait space occupancy on simulated and
empirical datasets to assess how each measure captures changes in trait
space size, density and position. Our results show that the correlation
between measures can vary both within and between measure categories
(Fig. 3), highlighting the importance of understanding the measure
classification for the interpretation of results. Furthermore, our
simulations show that different measures capture different types of
trait space change (Table 5), meaning that the use of multiple measures
is important for comprehensive interpretation of trait space occupancy.
We also show that the choice of measure impacts the interpretation of
group differences in empirical datasets (Table 6), again emphasizing
that measure choice has a real impact on the interpretation of specific
biological questions

\paragraph{Measures comparisons}\label{measures-comparisons}

Measures within the same category of trait space occupancy (size,
density or position) do not have the same level of correlation with each
other. For example, the average Euclidean distance from centroid (size)
is highly correlated to the sum of variances (size - correlation of
0.99) and somewhat correlated with the minimum spanning tree average
distance (density - correlation of 0.66) but poorly with the ellipsoid
volume (size - correlation of 0.17) and the minimum spanning tree
distances evenness (density - correlation of -0.05). Furthermore, the
fact that we have such a range of correlations for normal distributions
suggests that each measure can capture different summaries of space
occupancy ranging from obvious differences (for measures not strongly
correlated) to subtle ones (for measures strongly correlated).

\paragraph{Space shifting}\label{space-shifting-1}

Most measures capture no changes in space occupancy for the ``null''
(random) space reduction (in grey in Table 5). This is a desirable
behaviour for space occupancy measures since it will likely avoid false
positive errors in empirical studies that estimate biological processes
from space occupancy patterns (e.g.~competition Brusatte et al. 2008,
convergence Marcy et al. (2016), life history traits Healy et al.
(2019)). However, the average nearest neighbour distance and the sum of
ranges have a respectively positive and negative ``null'' median. This
is not especially a bad property but it should be kept in mind that even
random processes can increase or decrease these measure values.

Regarding the changes in size, the sum of variances and the average
Euclidean distance from centroid are good descriptors (Table 5).
However, as illustrated in the 2D examples in Fig. 2-B only the blue
change results (maximum limit - Table 5) should not result in a direct
change in overall size since the trait space is merely ``hollowed'' out.
That said, ``hollowing'' is more hard to conceptualise in many
dimensions and the measures can still be interpreted for comparing
groups (orange has a smaller volume than blue).

Regarding changes in density, the average nearest neigbhour distance and
the minimum spanning tree average distance consistently detect changes
in density with more precision for low density trait spaces (in blue in
Table 5). However, we can observe some degree of correlation between the
changes in density and the changes in size for most measure picking
either signal. This could be due to the use of normally distributed
spaces where a change in density often leads to a change in size. This
is not necessary the case with empirical data.

Regarding the changes in position of the trait space, all but the
average displacement measure seems to not be able to distinguish between
a random change and a displacement of the trait space (Table 5).
Furthermore, the average displacement measure does not distinguish
between and positive or a negative displacement of the trait space: this
might be due to the inherent complexity of \emph{position} in a
multidimensional trait space.

\paragraph{Empirical examples}\label{empirical-examples-1}

Although most differences are fairly consistent within each dataset with
one group having a higher space occupancy score than the other for
multiple measures, this difference can be more or less pronounced within
each dataset (ranging from no to nearly full overlap - BC
\(\in(0;0.995)\)) and sometimes even reversed. This indicates that
opposite conclusions can be drawn from a dataset depending on which
space occupancy measure is considered. For example, in Wright (2017),
crinoids after the Ordovician mass extinction have a higher median
measure value for all measures but for the average displacement. These
differences depending on the measures are also more pronounced in the
empirical datasets where the observations per group are unequal (Hopkins
and Pearson 2016; Healy et al. 2019).

\subsubsection{Caveats}\label{caveats}

While our simulations have been useful to illustrate the behavior of
diverse space occupancy measures, they have several caveats. First, the
simulated observations in the trait spaces are independent. This is not
the case in biology where observations can be spatially (Jones et al.
2015) or phylogenetically correlated (e.g. Beck and Lee 2014). Second,
the algorithm used to reduce the trait spaces might not always
accurately reflect changes. This might favour some specific measures
over others, in particular for the changes in density that modifies the
nearest neighbour density rather than changing the global density. This
algorithmic choice was made in order to not confound changes in density
along with changes in size. However, the results presented here probably
capture the general behaviour of each measure since results are
consistent between the simulated and empirical analysis. Furthermore,
\href{https://tguillerme.shinyapps.io/moms/}{\texttt{moms}} allows to
test the caveats mentioned above by uploading empirical trait space.

\subsubsection{Suggestions}\label{suggestions}

We insist that no measure is better than the next one and that
researchers should use the most appropriate metrics based on the measure
and trait space properties as well as their specific biological
question. However, following the findings of this study we suggest
several points:

First, we suggest using multiple measures to tackle different aspects of
the trait space. This follows the same logical thinking that the mean
might not be sufficient to describe a distribution (e.g.~the variance
might be a good additional descriptor). Although using multiple measures
is not uncommon in macroevolutionary studies (e.g. Halliday and Goswami
2016) or in ecology (Mammola 2019), they often do not cover contrasted
aspects of the trait space.

Second, we suggest selecting the measures that best help answering the
biological question at hand. If one studies an adaptive radiation in a
group of organisms, it is worth thinking what would be the expected null
model: would the group's size increase (radiation in all directions),
would it increase in density (niche specialisation) or would it shift in
position (radiation into a new set of niches)?

Third, we suggest to not name measures as the biological aspect they are
describing which can be vague (e.g. ``disparity'' or ``functional
dispersion'') but rather what they are measuring and why (e.g. ``we used
sum of ranges to capture the trait space size''). We believe this will
allow both a clearer understanding of what \emph{is} measured and a
better communication between ecology and evolution research where
measures can be similar but have different names (Fig. 3).

Multidimensional analyses have been acknowledged to be an essential
tool-kit modern biology but can often be counter-intuitive (Bellman
1957). It is thus crucial to accurately describe patterns in
multidimensional trait spaces to be able to link them to biological
processes. When summarising trait spaces, it is important to remember
that a pattern captured by a specific space occupancy measure is often
dependent on the properties of the trait space and of the particular
biological question of interest. We believe that having a clearer
understanding of both the properties of the trait space and the
associated space occupancy measures (e.g.~using
\href{https://tguillerme.shinyapps.io/moms/}{\texttt{moms}}) as well as
using novel space occupancy measures to answer specific questions will
be of great use to study biological processes in a multidimensional
world.
