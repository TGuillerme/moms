abstract = {Abstract The Generalized Euclidean Distance (GED) measure has been extensively used to conduct morphological disparity analyses based on palaeontological matrices of discrete characters. This is in part because some implementations allow the use of morphological matrices with high percentages of missing data without needing to prune taxa for a subsequent ordination of the data set. Previous studies have suggested that this way of using the GED may generate a bias in the resulting morphospace, but a detailed study of this possible effect has been lacking. Here, we test whether the percentage of missing data for a taxon artificially influences its position in the morphospace, and if missing data affects pre- and post-ordination disparity measures. We find that this use of the GED creates a systematic bias, whereby taxa with higher percentages of missing data are placed closer to the centre of the morphospace than those with more complete scorings. This bias extends into pre- and post-ordination calculations of disparity measures and can lead to erroneous interpretations of disparity patterns, especially if specimens present in a particular time interval or clade have distinct proportions of missing information. We suggest that this implementation of the GED should be used with caution, especially in cases with high percentages of missing data. Results recovered using an alternative distance measure, Maximum Observed Rescaled Distance (MORD), are more robust to missing data. As a consequence, we suggest that MORD is a more appropriate distance measure than GED when analysing data sets with high amounts of missing data.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim The n-dimensional hypervolume framework (Glob. Ecol. Biogeogr. [2014] 23:595–609) implemented through the R package 'hypervolume' is being increasingly used in ecology and biogeography. This approach offers a reliable means for comparing the niche of two or more species, through the calculation of the intersection between hypervolumes in a multidimensional space, as well as different distance metrics (minimum and centroid distance) and niche similarity indexes based on volume ratios (Sørensen–Dice and Jaccard similarity). However, given that these metrics have conceptual differences, there is still no consensus on which one(s) should be routinely used in order to assess niche similarity. The aim of this study is to provide general guidance for constructing and comparing n-dimensional hypervolumes. Location Virtual study site. Taxon Virtual species. Method First, the literature was screened to verify the usage of the different metrics in studies (2014–2018) relying on this method. Subsequently, a comparative analysis based on simulated morphological and bioclimatic traits was performed, taking into consideration different analytical dimensions, sample sizes and algorithms for hypervolume construction. Results Literature survey revealed that there was no clear preference for one metric over the others in current studies relying on the n-dimensional hypervolume method. In simulated data, a high correlation among similarity and distance metrics was found for all datatypes considered. For most analytical scenarios, using at least one overlap and one distance metric would be therefore the most appropriate approach for assessing niche overlap. Yet, when hypervolumes are fully disjunct, similarity metrics become uninformative and calculating the two distance metrics is recommended. The sample size and the choice of algorithm and dimensionality can lead to significant variations in the overlap of hypervolumes in the hyperspace, and therefore should be carefully considered. Main conclusions Best practise for constructing n-dimensional hypervolumes and assessing their similarity are drawn, representing a practical aid for scientists using the 'hypervolume' R package in their research. These recommendations apply to most datatypes and analytical scenarios. The R scripts published alongside this methodological study can be modified for performing large-scale analyses of species niches or automatically assessing pairwise similarity metrics among multiple hypervolume objects.},

abstract="Morphological disparity, the measure of morphological variation among species and higher taxa, has been at the core of an important research program in paleobiology over the last 25 years. Its quantification is based on the construction and exploration of morphospaces, multidimensional spaces spanned by a set of morphological descriptors, and benefits from a well-established analytical protocol. Two main classes of indices are routinely used to describe the distribution of taxa in morphospace in terms of their spread and spacing. This unique focus on the morphological component of clade dynamics has promoted disparity as a distinct measure of biodiversity complementing traditional taxonomic proxies. Disparity studies have led to improved understanding of the evolutionary history of major clades and fostered new research on adaptive radiations, rates of evolution, and morphological innovation. Currently, active areas of methodological development focus on characterizing the geometric properties of morphospaces, devising indices that describe the structure of disparity, and incorporating phylogenetic information. There have also been increasing efforts to identify the determinants of disparity, from developmental to functional and ecological considerations, leading to conceptual extensions such as allometric disparity. The importance of trends, extinction, and chance as factors in the evolution of disparity remains relatively underexplored and needs more attention.",
